React is an open source JavaScript view library, used for implementing user interfaces (UI). It was originally created by Jordan Walke and launched by Facebook in 2013.

How is JavaScript and HTML linked? With a syntax, called **JSX**. This returns HTML content, through a function written in JavaScript. To write JavaScript within JSX, you simply include the code within curly braces. However, because JSX is not valid JavaScript, JSX code must be compiled into JavaScript. **Babel** is the most popular transpiler.

In nested JSX, **one parent element** must wrap all the other elements. Otherwise, elements with no parent will not transpile. In order to use JSX we need to import React at the beginning of the file:

    import React from "react"
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom"

### **VIRTUAL DOM**
React uses a **Virtual DOM**, that is, an in-memory representation of the DOM. So, we can render JSX directly to the HTML DOM using React Rendering API known as ReactDOM. It offers a simple method to render React elements to the DOM which look like this:

    ReactDOM.render.(componentToRender, targetNode)

The _targetNode_ is the DOM node that you want to render the component to.

**STATE:** each component has its own state. They communicate through a **global state**.

### **COMPONENTS**

**Components** are JavaScript objects, and one of the most important elements of React. **components** can be **reused** and **combined**.

They are the building blocks of any React application. A typical web in React might be made with several components, where components are self contained sections of contents. For example, a nav-bar, an article, a side-bar, in a website might be a component. Our mission is to build these components and render them into the webpage, by React. Here's an example of a custom component named _<Page />_:

    import React from 'react'
    import ReactDom from 'react-dom'

    function Page() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Reasons why I'm learning React</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>It's cool</li>
                    <li>It will help my find a better job</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        )
    }

    const myPage = document.getElementById("root"); // This is the place in my DOM where it will print my <Page /> component.

    ReactDom.render(<Page />, myPage);


Components contain: 
1) template 
2) logic

__JSX syntax__ allows us to easily create the HTML style-like templates in components: but, though it seems HTML, it has little differences. In the background, it transpiles this JSX into HTML, and renders this HTML to the DOM.

One main difference: in JSX we use the keyword **"className"**, camel case, and when it converts into HTML it turns into **"class"**.

A component is, basically, a function. We declare it with a capital letter. At the end of the file, we export it. For example:

    import './App.css';
    
    function App() {
      return (
      
      const title = "App components";
      const likes = 50;
      const link = "http://google.com";
      
        <div className="App">
          <div className="content">
           <h1>{ title }</h1>
           <p>Liked { likes } times</p>
           
           <p>{ 10 }</p>
           <p>{ 'Hello everyone' }</p>
           <p>{ [1,2,3,4,5] }</p>
           <a href={link}>Google</a>
                 
          </div>
        </div>
      );
    }
    
    export default App;"

We can output strings and numbers (which are converted to strings), calling the variables with curly braces {}, but we can't pass booleans nor objects.

In JSX, any element can be written with a __self closing tag__, and every element **must be closed**.

    <div /> // can can use it this way if we leave it empty
    or 
    <div> </div> // OK!

In web applications, components are structured in a way they make a **components tree**. The **root component** is the first component rendered to the DOM, and sits at the very top of this tree. Next, if we are to make new components we nest them in the root one.

![ROOT COMPONENT CHART](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92860255/215748109-9ef43e75-e8ac-4f9d-a6d1-d47b252a3469.png)

And the code in the root component would look like this:

    import './App.css';
    import Navbar from './Navbar';
    
    function App() {
    
        const title = "Welcome to the new blog";
        return (
            <div className="App">
              <Navbar />
              <div className="content">
                <h1>{ title }</h1>
              </div>
            </div>
        );
    }
    
    export default App;
 
 We can add as many components as we like, and nest one component into another. 
 
There are two ways to create a React Component. One of them, is to use a JavaScript function. We call it: *Stateless Functional Component*, and we declare them with a capital letter:

    const DemoComponent = function () {
        return (
            <div className="CustomClass" />
        );
    };
 
 The other way to define React Component is with the ES6 class syntax. 
 
     class kitten extends React.Component {
     constructor(props) {
     super(props);
     }
     render () {
     return (
     <h1>Hello World!</h1>
     );
     }
    }
    React.DOM.render(`kitten', document.getElementById("node"));
 
 This creates an ES6 class **kitten** which extends the React component. So, the kitten class has **access to many useful React features**.
 
 ### **ADDING STYLES**
 
We generally import a css file into the app file. But, we can also do some in-line style, a bit different than HTML syntaxis. Our inline styling is a **JavaScript object**, and cannot use hiphens. So, we camelCase each CSS property (for instance, we say "backgroundColor", and not background-color). Let's see an example:

    const Navbar = () => {
      return (
        <nav className="navbar">
          <h1>The Dojo Blog</h1>
          <div className="links">
            <a href="/">Home</a>
            <a href="/create" style={{ 
              color: 'white', 
              backgroundColor: '#f1356d',
              borderRadius: '8px' 
            }}>New Blog</a>
          </div>
        </nav>
      );
    }
 
    export default Navbar;
 
### **CLICK EVENTS**

When you have a web, there many events happening: hover events, click events, keyboard events etc. This is the way you add a click event when user clicks a button:
const Home = () => {

    const handleClick = () => {
        console.log('Hello World!');
    }

    return ( 
        <div className="home">
            <h2>Homepage</h2>
            <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
        </div>
     );
    }

    export default Home;
    
We do not use (), beacuse this would fire the event, event without clickiing the button. But what would happen if we'd like to pass a function with a parameter? We have to wrap it in an anonimous function. This is the way we'd do it:

    const Home = () => {

      const handleClick = (e) => {
        console.log('hello ninjas', e);
      }

      const handleClickAgain = (name, e) => {
        console.log('hello ' + name, e.target);
      }

      return (
        <div className="home">
          <h2>Homepage</h2>
          <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
          <button onClick={(e) => handleClickAgain('mario', e)}>Click me again</button>
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default Home;

e => is the event object, that we access when the event occurs. In this case, on clicking the button handleClickAgain we print by console the target of the event object.

###Â **STATE or data motch** and **HOOKS**

When we talk about **state** we talk about data being used by that component at a point in time. That data could be an array of values, booleans, strings, objects, any kind our component uses.

If a variable changes its value, and it is not reactive, we won't see the changes in our browser. To see the new values, we have to use a **hook**. You can identify a hook by its name because they usually start by the word _use_... 

States are generally used to paint information on the browser and to make React aware when some value changes. But we can also use states to collect values from the user. Usually to collect data from a form we do not use the useState hook, but rather the useRef hook. But, although in React JS both the useState and the useRef hook work, when we use React to make mobile applications, with React Native, the useRef does not work.

In this first case, we'll focus on the hook **useState**. The useState hook is a function that help us create a reactive value, and provides us with the way to change that value whenever we want. 

To use this hook, we have to import it at the beginning of the file, from the react library. This is an example:

    import { useState } from "react";

    const Home = () => {
      // let name = 'mario';
      const [name, setName] = useState('mario');
      const [age, setAge] = useState(25);

      const handleClick = () => {
        // name = 'luigi';
        setName('luigi');
        setAge(30);
      }

      return (
        <div className="home">
          <h2>Homepage</h2>
          <p>{ name } is { age } years old</p>
          <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default Home;

We store the state in some kind of value. We use an array that grabs two values: first, the initial value, the second one is a function that we can use to change that initial value, and most of the times starts with "set...", and then whatever we called that initial value. For example:
    
    const [name, setName] = useState('mario');

Then, when I use that value later, in the template, is going to get whatever the state of that value is:

    <p>{ name } is { age } years old</p>

So, when this value changes, is going to change in the template as well. 

    setName('luigi');
   
**setName** here is triggering React, and it re-renders the component, and when it re-renders, we have the new value of _name_ in the component. So we will use the **useState** hook when we need to use a value that changes.

### **useRef** 
There are times when we need to modify an element of the DOM in an imperative way, for example when we want to perform an animation, play a multimedia file or force a "focus" on a field. This is where having the direct reference to the DOM element using **useRef** comes in handy.

    import { useRef } from "react";

    function App() {
      const inputRef = useRef(null);
      const resultRef = useRef(null);

      const makeThings = () => {
        alert(inputRef.current.value);
        resultRef.current.innerHTML = inputRef.current.value;
      };

      return (
        <div>
          <input type="text" ref={ inputRef }/>
          <button onClick={ makeThings }>Just Do It</button>

          <br />
          <div ref={ resultRef }></div>
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default App;
   
### **useEffect**

This hook triggers a code every time a certain state changes.

### **PROPS**

Props are used to pass information from one component to another. It can be from a parent component to a child, or from the child to the parent.
